Header Handlers
===============

This directory contains header handlers for REDbot. They are in charge of
taking the values values for each header, parsing it, setting any
header-specific notes that are appropriate, and then joining the values
together in a data structure that represents the header.

Note that not all tests are in these files; ones that require coordination 
between several headers' values, for example, belong in a separate type of 
test (as cache testing is done, in _cache\_check.py_). This is because headers 
can come in any order, so you can't be sure that another header's value will
be available when your header parser runs.


Adding New Headers
------------------

It's pretty easy to add support for new headers into REDbot. To start, fork
the source and add a new file into this directory, whose name corresponds to
the header's name, but in all lowercase, and with special characters (most
commonly, _-_) transposed to an underscore.

For example, if your header's name is `Foo-Example`, the appropriate filename
is `foo_example.py`.

If your header name doesn't work with this convention, please raise an issue
in [REDbot's tracker](https://github.com/mnot/redbot/issues).

### The _parse_ Function

Each header file should define a _parse_ function. This function must take
the following parameters:

 * `subject` - the subject ID of the test, for reference in notes.
 * `value` - a header field value; see below.
 * `msg` - the current HttpMessage object (either HttpRequest or HttpResponse).

A value is a header field value; by default, it corresponds to a header line.
For example:

    Cache-Control: foo, bar
    Cache-Control: baz
  
would be sent in as two calls to _parse_; one as "foo, bar" and one as "baz". 

The _parse_ function must return a data structure that's a suitable
representation of the header field; it could be a dictionary, a list, an
integer, a string, etc. Take a look at similar headers to see what data
structures they use.

_parse_ is where you set notes that are specific to a header field-value,
rather than all field-values for that header.

If parsing fails, it should return `None`.

### The _join_ function

Each header file also needs to define a _join_ function. This coalesces the
output of one or more calls to _parse_ to produce a single data structure
that represents that header's value for the HTTP message.

It takes the following parameters:

 * `subject` - the subject ID of the test, for reference in notes.
 * `values` - a list of values, returned from _parse_.
 * `msg` - the current HttpMessage object.
 
Use _join_ to set notes that need to have the entire field's composite
value, rather than just one portion. Usually, these are tests for the 
header's semantics.


### Decorators for _parse_

There are also some handy decorators in _\_\_init\_\_.py_ that help with
parsing, including:

 * `GenericHeaderSyntax` - Splits comma-separated list values, so that  
   `values` contains a value per item.
   
    For example, `Cache-Control: foo, bar` will get `["foo", "bar"]` if 
    _parse_ is decorated with `@GenericHeaderSyntax`.
    
    Note that this decorator can ONLY be used on headers whose syntax does
    not allow an unquoted comma to appear; for example, it cannot be used
    on the `Set-Cookie` syntax, because it allows a bare date that includes
    a comma.
 
 * `CheckFieldSyntax` - Checks the syntax of a field against a regex; if
   it does not match, a warning note will be set, and None will be
   forcibly returned; the code in _parse_ will not be run.
   
   This decorator takes two arguments; `expression`, containing a regex, and
   `reference`, which is a URI that's used to point people to more information
   about the syntax, if there's an error.
   
   `regex` is evaluated with `re.VERBOSE`, and already has start and end
   anchors, as well as whitespace trimming; see the code for details.
   
   See _message.http_syntax.py_ for some handy pre-defined regexen, based upon 
   the HTTP ABNF.

* `DeprecatedHeader` - indicates that the header should not be used. Takes one argument, a URL
  to the notice of deprecation.

* Every header needs to have exactly one of:

  * `RequestHeader` assures that the header is only used in requests.

  * `ResponseHeader` is just like `RequestHeader`, except that it assures that
  the header is only used in responses.

  * `RequestOrResponseHeader` indicates that it can occur in either requests or responses.

  * `ResponseOrPutHeader` indicates that it typically occurs in responses, but might also show up
  in a PUT request.

### Decorators for _join_

Likewise, the following decorators cqn be used for the _join_ function:

 * `SingleFieldValue` - For use on field values that expect only one value. 
   If more than one is present, it will set a warning note, and only send
   through the last value in `values`.   


### Setting Notes

_parse_ can and should set header-specific notes as appropriate. Notes
are collected in _speak.py_; see that file for details of the appropriate 
format. They are set by calling `add_note` on the `msg` object that's
passed to _parse_.

`add_note` expects the following parameters:

 * `name` - the header field name
 * `note` - a subclass of `redbot.speak.Note` (usually, one 
   you've added)
 * Optionally, any number of keyword arguments that are passed to the
   note's strings when they're formatted. See existing notes for 
   examples.

When writing new notes, it's important to keep in mind that the `text`
field is expected to contain valid HTML; any variables you pass to it will
be escaped for you before rendering.


### Writing Tests

You can test your _parse_ function by subclassing
`redbot.message.headers.HeaderTest`; it expects the following class
properties:

 * `name` - the header field-name
 * `inputs` - a list of header field-values, one item per line. 
   E.g., `["foo", "foo, bar"]`
 * `expected_out` - the data structure that _parse_ should return, given
   the inputs
 * `expected_err` - a list of `redbot.speak.Note` classes that are expected
   to be set with `add_note` when parsing the inputs
    
You can create any number of tests this way; they will be run automatically 
when _tests/test\_headers.py_ is run.
